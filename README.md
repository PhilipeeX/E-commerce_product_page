## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla JavaScript

### What I learned

I mainly learned how to manipulate html using DOM. Build a frontend part of a website is enjoyable a lot, most because without
figma it can lead more than we think. 

### Continued development

The next steps I'm planning to is to consume some API's using Vanilla JS with the knowledge which I already have, so the idea is to combine everything and put it in a project.

### Useful resources

- [Flex box malven](https://flexbox.malven.co/) - This website always help me when I need to refresh some stuff about flexbox.

I was not developing frontend websites for more than 8 months, and now I feel it's like riding bike, we never forget what we learn.
